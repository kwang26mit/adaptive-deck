Text: Electric vehicles have arrived. With technology led by Tesla, and all of the world's 
major car manufacturers following along behind, electric vehicles are now a common sight on 
the roads of most developed countries.  Yet the situation in less developed countries is 
rather different;  the only African country to have started the change to electric vehicles 
is South Africa and even there, electric vehicle sales still account for less than 1% of the 
total. In South America, the situation is better, with all Latin American countries beginning 
the move towards electric vehicles, particularly Columbia which, in 2020, had a third of the 
continent's total electric car fleet. In Russia, the wealthy were investing in imported electric 
cars until the invasion of Ukraine stopped most imports; a very small number of electric vehicles 
are manufactured locally. In India the government is promoting the purchase of electric vehicles 
with tax exemptions and other incentives. So electric cars have arrived, and their share of the 
market is increasing almost worldwide.
